        <strong>LeBron James</strong> is an American basketball player with the Los Angeles Lakers. James first garnered
        national attention
        as the top high school basketball player in the country. With his unique combination of size, athleticism and
        court
        vision, he became a four-time NBA MVP. After leading the Miami Heat to titles in 2012 and 2013, James returned
        to
        Cleveland and helped the franchise claim its first championship in 2016.

    <p>

        ever
        selected for this award. His team also won the Division III state title for the second year in a row.

        In January 2018, at age 33, James surpassed Bryant as the youngest player to accumulate 30,000 career points and
        became the seventh player in NBA history to achieve that milestone. The feat put him just more than 8,000 points
        shy
        of Abdul-Jabbar's all-time record of 38,387 points.

        In 2019, James surpassed Jordan's career tally of 32,292 points to move into fourth place on the all-time list.

        predecessor's shocking death in a helicopter accident.

        At 19, LeBron became the youngest member of the basketball squad in 2004 Athens Olympics but he spent most of
        the time on the bench.</p>
    <p>He made NBA history again in 2005, when he became the youngest player to score more than 50 points in one game.
        He was selected for the NBA All-Star game for the first time.
        After the 2006 Playoffs, James and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60 million contract extension with a
        player option with the option of seeking a new contract as an unrestricted free agent.</p>

    <p>James competed at his third Olympic Games in 2012, in London, along with teammates Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony
        and Kobe Bryant, and the team brought home the second consecutive Olympic gold.</p>

    <p>At the end of the 2012-13 season, against the San Antonio Spurs, Miami transformed a seemingly impossible
        championship win into reality, winning their second consecutive national title with a 3-4 victory.

    <h3>2014-2018</h3>
    <p>
        In 2014, LeBron James opted out of his contract with Miami Heat and signed with Cleveland Cavaliers. In 2014–15
        season, Cleveland Cavaliers advanced to the NBA finals and in the process James became first player since the
        1960s to play in five consecutive NBA finals.</p>

    <p>His 2015–16 season was marred by controversies which also included the midseason firing of Cavaliers' coach
        David Blatt. But in spite of all this LeBron James performed admirably and the third player to record a
        triple-double in an NBA Finals Game.
